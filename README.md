# KNN_Algorithm
KNN algorithm for machine learning.

This project implements the KNN algorithm with weighted voting on the MNIST data set.
The MNIST_train.cvs file is used as the training data set and MNIST_test.csv as the test data set. 
A description of the MNIST data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data 

The output from the program display as:
•	value of K 
•	for each test sample, print both the desired class and the computed class, where desired class, is the class label as given in the data set, and computed class, is what your code produces as the output for the sample. 
•	the accuracy rate
•	number of misclassified test samples, and 
•	total number of test samples 
Sample output is as follows. 

```
K = 4
...
Desired Class: 9   Computed Class: 9
Desired Class: 9   Computed Class: 7
Desired Class: 9   Computed Class: 9
Desired Class: 9   Computed Class: 9
Desired Class: 9   Computed Class: 9
Accuracy Rate:  86.0 %
Number of misclassified test samples: 7
Total number of test samples:  50
```
